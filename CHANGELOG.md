## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.0] - 2026-08-31

Initial MVP release.

### Added

- JSON configuration system with pydantic models, `${VAR:default}` environment
  expansion, JSON Schema export/check, and enforced judge independence
  (judge provider and model family must differ from every teacher).
- Provider layer: generic OpenAI-compatible provider with retries, timeouts and
  structured-output parsing; OpenRouter, OpenCode Zen (`chat_completions`
  style), MLGW, local (Ollama-compatible) adapters; deterministic mock provider
  with generic JSON-Schema instance generation; sqlite response cache keyed on
  provider/model/role/messages/params/RAG context.
- Observability: per-call JSONL usage logs (tokens, latency, retries, cache
  hits, estimated cost from optional pricing config).
- Model and role registries with kind inference (teacher/critic/judge).
- Domain packs: `security` (CWE/severity/evidence schemas, security teacher,
  coding teacher, adversarial judge, quality gates) and `coding` (code analysis
  schemas); generic fallback pack for future domains.
- Pipeline engine: role steps, pipeline context, cost modes (cheap/standard/
  maximum), optional teacher ablation via explicit steps, unresolved-verdict
  rejection, `recitation_risk` tagging from case source dates vs teacher
  knowledge cutoffs.
- Local RAG: text/markdown/code/JSON loaders, markdown-aware chunker, fastembed
  (ONNX, CPU) embeddings with deterministic hashing fallback backend, sqlite +
  numpy vector store with full retrieval provenance.
- Dataset tooling: case builder (JSON cases and plain code files, git commit
  dates), JSONL writer with teacher/judge/RAG provenance, record validation,
  quality gate, exact + near-duplicate detection (Jaccard shingles),
  source-grouped train/validation/test splitting plus post-cutoff holdout.
- Training preparation: validate/split/export for TRL; QLoRA, evaluate and
  export stubs (phase 2); GPU smoke module for the manual CI job.
- Experiments: dated run directories with config snapshot, dataset copy,
  metrics (contamination stats, teacher/judge agreement rates) and a generated
  markdown report including correlated-bias warnings.
- CLI (`brainforge`): `config`, `models`, `roles`, `teacher`, `pipeline`,
  `rag`, `dataset`, `train` command groups with rich output.
- Documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP, mkdocs-material site.
- CI: GitLab pipeline with lint (ruff), secrets (gitleaks), tests, config
  validation, build, mkdocs Pages, and a manual GPU-tagged training smoke job.
- Example cases spanning a teacher knowledge cutoff (command injection,
  SQL injection, stored XSS) and a working example configuration.
